= Spring to Kubernetes Native with Quarkus
:experimental:

*Spring Cloud* is a framework for building microservices applications with Spring but also includes support for *non-functional microservices capabilities* such as configuration management, service discovery, resiliency, load balancing, distributed logging, and so on. The main goal of Spring Cloud is to allow developers to quickly build microservices along with common cloud development patterns. Spring Cloud accomplishes this by providing a rich collection of Java APIs and services for microservices development.

A frequently asked question is *how does Quarkus with OpenShift handle the Spring Cloud capabilities?* In this lab, you will learn how efficiently Quarkus with OpenShift allows developers to integrate non-functional microservices capabilities into Kubernetes resources in *Kubernetes Native way*. 

== Direct Access to OpenShift ConfigMaps and Secrets

Quarkus includes the kubernetes-config extension which allows developers to use Kubernetes https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/configmap[ConfigMaps^] and https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/secret[Secrets^] as a configuration source, without having to mount them into the Pod running the Quarkus application. This *configuration management* traditionally can be managed by https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config[Spring Cloud Config^] and https://www.consul.io/[Consul^].

In this step, we'll use a ConfigMap to handle this capability. Go to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-project/configmaps[Config Maps^] in Developer Console, then click on `Create Config Map`:

image::create-configmap.png[configmap.png, 900]

Replace the existing `ConfigMap` resource with the following code in YAML editor:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfigmap
  namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-project
data:
  message.hello.quarkus: Kubernetes Native Java, Quarkus
----

image::myconfigmap.png[configmap.png, 700]

Add _quarkus-kubernetes-config_ extension to `quarkus-petclinic-web-v2` project in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn -q quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="kubernetes-config" -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m3-labs/quarkus-petclinic-web-v2
----

This extension works by reading ConfigMaps and Secrets directly from the Kubernetes API server using the https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes-client[Kubernetes Client^]. The extension understands the following types of ConfigMaps and Secrets as input sources:

* ConfigMaps and Secrets that contain _literal data_
* ConfigMaps and Secrets created from files named _application.properties_, _application.yaml_ or _application.yml_.

You should see in the output:

[source,console]
----
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-kubernetes-config has been installed
----

Open `application.properties` file in `src/main/resources` of *quarkus-petclinic-web-v2* project then append the following configuration:

[source,shell,role="copypaste"]
----
%prod.quarkus.kubernetes-config.enabled=true
%prod.quarkus.kubernetes-config.config-maps=myconfigmap
----

[NOTE]
====
The properties obtained from the ConfigMaps and Secrets have a higher priority than (i.e. they override) any properties of the same name that are found in _application.properties_ (or the YAML equivalents), but they have lower priority than properties set via Environment Variables or Java System Properties. Furthermore, when multiple ConfigMaps (or Secrets) are used, ConfigMaps (or Secrets) defined later in the list have a higher priority that ConfigMaps defined earlier in the list. Finally, when both ConfigMaps and Secrets are used, the latter always a higher priority than the former.
====

Open `WelcomeResource.java` class file in `src/main/java/org/acme/rest` of *quarkus-petclinic-web-v2* project, and add the following code:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    @ConfigProperty(name = "message.hello.quarkus")
    String message;
----

Then replace `get()` method with the following codes:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
    public TemplateInstance get() {
        return welcome.data("active", "home")
                .data("message", message);
    }
----

Also, don’t forget to add the import statement by adding the import statement for *WelcomeResource* near the top:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;
----

Let's the Qute template to show the message that refers to OpenShift ConfigMap. Open `welcome.html` file in `src/main/resources/templates` of *quarkus-petclinic-web-v2* project, and replace the following code:

[source,html,role="copypaste"]
----
<h2>Welcome, {message}</h2>
----

*Rebuild* and *redeploy* the people application via running the following maven plugin in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean package -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m3-labs/quarkus-petclinic-web-v2
----

When the build and deployment complete, the app is deployed to OpenShift. Back on the http://petclinic-web-v2-{{ USER_ID }}-project.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}[Welcome Page^] then you shoud see this:

== Add Health Probe to Quarkus

Spring Cloud has in-application libraries for creating resilient, fault-tolerant microservices using https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Hystrix^] (with bulkhead and circuit breaker patterns) and https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon[Ribbon^] (for load balancing). But that alone is not enough, and when it is combined with Kubernetes health checks, process restarts and auto-scaling capabilities turn microservices into a true antifragile system.

Quarkus application can utilize the *MicroProfile Health* specification through the _SmallRye Health_ extension to provide information about their state(_liveness_ and _readiness_) to external viewers which is typically useful in cloud environments where automated processes must be able to determine whether the application should be discarded or restarted.

When you deployed the the remaining microservices(_Visits_, _Customers_, _Web_), the `/health` endpoint in each microservice is automatically exposed directly that can be used to run the health check procedures. For example, the *customers* service is still running, so you can exercise the default (no-op) health check with this command in a separate Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste copypaste"]
----
curl $(oc get route customers-service -o=go-template --template={% raw %}'{{ .spec.host }}'{% endraw %})/health | jq
----

The output shows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Database connections health check",
      "status": "UP"
    }
  ]
}
----

The general _outcome_ of the health check is computed as a logical AND of all the declared health check procedures. Quarkus extensions can also provide default health checks out of the box, which is why you see the `Database connections health check` above, since we are using a database extension.

Let’s fill in the class by creating a new RESTful endpoint which will be used by OpenShift to probe our services. Open an empty `OwnersHealthCheck.java` class file in `src/main/java/org/acme/rest` of *quarkus-petclinic-customers-service* project, and add the following code:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.rest;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.acme.service.OwnersService;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class OwnersHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Inject
    OwnersService ownersService;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {

        if (ownersService.findAll() != null) {
            return HealthCheckResponse.named("Success of Owners Health Check!!!").up().build();
        } else {
            return HealthCheckResponse.named("Failure of Owners Health Check!!!").down().build();
        }
    }
}
----

The `call()` method exposes an HTTP GET endpoint which will return the status of the service. The logic of this check does a simple query to the underlying database to ensure the connection to it is stable and available. The method is also annotated with MicroProfile's `@Readiness` annotation, which directs Quarkus to expose this endpoint as a health check at `/health/ready`.

*Rebuild* and *redeploy* the people application via running the following maven plugin in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean package -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m3-labs/quarkus-petclinic-customers-service
----

When the build completes, the app is deployed to OpenShift. Access the health endpoint again using _curl_ and the result looks like:

[source,sh,role="copypaste copypaste"]
----
curl $(oc get route customers-service -o=go-template --template={% raw %}'{{ .spec.host }}'{% endraw %})/health | jq
----

The result should be:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Database connections health check",
      "status": "UP"
    },
    {
      "name": "Success of Owners Health Check!!!",
      "status": "UP"
    }
  ]
}
----

You now see the default health check, along with your new customer(owner) health check.

[NOTE]
====
You can define separate readiness and liveness probes using `@Liveness` and `@Readiness` annotations and access them separately at `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.
====

Back on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-project[Topology View^] and click on `DC(customers-service)` then select `Edit Health Checks` in *Actions* dropbox:

image::customers-dc.png[health.png, 900]

You should see `Readiness Probe` and `Liveness Probe` are already added along with Quarkus MicroProfile health specification:

image::health-probe.png[health.png, 700]

Click on `Edit Probe` in _Readniess Probe_ then you should see the way to check if the container is ready to handle requests. A failed readiness probe means that a container should not receive any traffic from a proxy, even if it's running:

image::readiness-probe.png[health.png, 700]

== Congratulations!

You have successfully integrated non-functional microservices capabilities into Kubernetes/OpenShift resources in *Kubernetes Native way*.
