= Getting Started with Spring Petclinic

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework[Spring^] is one of the most widely used Java frameworks for building applications. For the Java platform, The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications with dependency injection, events, resources, data transactions, web applications based on MVC(Model-view-controller) pattern, and more. It basically aims to simplify enterprise application development for Java developers. 

While the Spring framework focuses more on providing enterprise features to developers, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot^] aims to shorten the code length and provide Spring developers an easier way to develop standalone microservices with an embedded runtime (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), opinionated starter dependencies, externalized configuration, and more. However, it's *not* the most suitable framework when it comes to writing cloud-native microservices, designing serverless applications for event-driven architecture that are deployed to cloud infrastructure such as https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-kubernetes[Kubernetes^], https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform^], and take advantage of the underlying platform to do amazing things. In this workshop, we will walk you through how *Spring developers* are able to refactor *Spring* applications to Kubernetes-native microservices with *Quarkus* for dealing with these challenges. 

== What is Spring PetClinic Project?

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework[Spring^] is one of the most widely used Java frameworks for building applications. For the Java platform, The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications with dependency injection, events, resources, data transactions, web applications based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and more. It aims to simplify enterprise application development for Java developers.

== Getting Ready for the labs

[NOTE]
====
If you’ve already completed other labs today then you need to *delete* an exiting workspace in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.
====

You will be using VS Code server based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces] **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ DS_URL }}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

image::login_with_openshift.png[login,800]

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ DS_USER_PASSWORD }}`

image::che-login.png[login,800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

image::auth-access.png[auth-access, 800]
====

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

* *Git Repo URL*: `https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs/tree/ocp-4.12`

image::ds-landing.png[ds, 800]

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace quarkus-workshop*. It takes less than *30* seconds to finish the process.

image::starting-workspace.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this information page, select `Start your workspace` to continue  using your workspace.

image::starting-workspace-info.png[ds, 800]
====

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

image::ds-workspace.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this infomation page, check on `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'projects'`. Then, select `Yes, I trust the authors. Trust folder and enable all features`.

image::ds-trust-popup.png[ds, 800]
====

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

== Running the Spring Petclinic

Let's run the Spring Petclinic application. in a VS Code Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m3-labs/spring-petclinic -DskipTests
----

[NOTE]
====
The first time you build the app, new dependencies may be downloaded via maven. This should only happen once, after that things will go even faster.
====

You should see:

[source,none]
----
INFO 326 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8081 (http) with context path ''
INFO 326 --- [  restartedMain] DeferredRepositoryInitializationListener : Triggering deferred initialization of Spring Data repositories…
INFO 326 --- [  restartedMain] DeferredRepositoryInitializationListener : Spring Data repositories initialized!
INFO 326 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.s.petclinic.PetClinicApplication     : Started PetClinicApplication in 3.918 seconds (JVM running for 4.28)
INFO 326 --- [nio-8081-exec-1] o.a.c.c.C.[Tomcat].[localhost].[/]       : Initializing Spring DispatcherServlet 'dispatcherServlet'
INFO 326 --- [nio-8081-exec-1] o.s.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet        : Initializing Servlet 'dispatcherServlet'
INFO 326 --- [nio-8081-exec-1] o.s.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet        : Completed initialization in 7 ms
----

The Spring Boot application should be running with _8081_ port because you will initialize _8080_ port to run a Quarkus application later.

VS Code will also detect that the Quarkus app opens port `8081` for web requests. When prompted, *open the port `8081`*, which opens a small web browser in VS Code:

image::open-port-spring.png[port, 700]

Then select `Open Link` to redirect to the external URL of the Spring Boot application:

image::open-link-spring.png[port, 700]

You should see the Spring Petclinic welcome page (you may need to click the _reload_ icon):

image::welcome-spring-petclinic.png[port, 900]

Select the URL link at the upper right to open the same default page in a separate browser tab:

image::crw-open-spring-page.png[page, 800]

`leave this page/tab open` because you will go through logical views and implemented the use cases of Spring Petclinic application in the next labs.
